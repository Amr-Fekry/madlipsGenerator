# Madlips Generator Game

This mini-project started as a practice of the basics of Python by following lessons of Full-Stack Track in 1MAC initiative on Udacity, and extended to self-learning the creation of GUIs using Python's Tkinter built-in module and PyQt5 package.

skills developed while building this app:

* version 1 of the game (V1) is a practice of the basics of programming using {Pyhton}
* version 2 of the game (V2) is a practice of making GUIs using Pyhton's built-in {Tkinter} module
* version 3 of the game (V3) is a practice of making GUIs using {PyQt5} package along with {OOP} in Python

Enjoy playing the game. and any feedback for the code would be appreciated.
