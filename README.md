# Madlips Generator Game

This is my implementation of the famous [Madlips game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) for two players using Python. I have created three different versions of the game, an intial one for the command line interface, and another two versions with graphical user interfaces using Tkinter and PyQt5.

### Running the game locally:
-  [Python3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher is required.
- Clone/download the repsitory and `cd` into it.
- Install external dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the CLI version: `python version1_CLI.py`
- Run Tkinter GUI version: `python version2_GUI_Tkinter.py`
- Run PyQt5 GUI version: `python version2_GUI_PyQt5.py`

### Known bugs:
The PyQt5 version of the game doesn't start a new game properly and the application needs to be restarted for a new game.


Enjoy the game.
